Jesse holds a B.A in Urban Studies, summa cum laude, from Columbia University, along with an A.M. in Architecture from Harvard University. He is completing a PhD in the History and Theory of Urbanism and Media Studies, a dual degree at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies. His evolving dissertation "Archaeologies of the Urban Database Imaginary: Documentary Media in Urban Research and Experimental Cartography from the 1920s to the Contemporary" exposes a pre-history of today's geo-located media arts, architectural and urbanist practices. The center of this historical and theoretical project is Gy&ouml;rgy Kepes and Kevin Lynch's "The Perceptual Form of the City," a multimedia investigation of metropolitan Boston in the 1950s conducted at MIT.<br /><br />
In addition to Kepes and Lynch's work, the project also addresses an extended geneaology of the city symphony genre, including the photography, films and screenplays of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy in conjunction with the films and writings of Dziga Vertov; Robert Smithson's re-mapping of New Jersey; Venturi, Scott-Brown &amp; Izenour's <i>Learning from Las Vegas</i>; and Reyner Banham's 1974 BBC documentary <i>Reyner Banham Loves Los Angeles</i>.<br /><br />
